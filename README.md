# SAMWOOD

## Segmentation and Analysis of (Actual & fossil) Wood Anatomical Sections with SAM2

This project explores the use and adaptation of SAM2 (Segment Anything Model 2), a Vision Transformer, for the segmentation and measurement of wood cells in anatomical section.

The main objective is to automate the extraction of anatomical characteristics from fossil wood by incorporating a guided approach that follows the growth direction and take measurements from the pith to the bark.The automated approche samwood is being developed to structure and process this data efficiently.

This project is part of a Master's 2 course in palaeoecology, focusing on the analysis of fossile plant growth in the Permian and Triassic periods. The approach remains exploratory, with the aim of assessing the potential of deep learning techniques for reconstructing palaeoenvironments from fossil wood.
